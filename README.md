<h3>Online</h3> - highly recommended!
<a href="https://cs1xd3.online/ShowModulePublish?modulePublishId=6e20c5d4-51db-445c-8183-8647fbb28cf1">Click on the link</a> to view our project in McMaster Outreach IDE

<h4>Note we don't recommend trying to view it locally because we have created our web app on the McMaster Outreach IDE in which we have imported the code using their database and our teammates' names.</h4>
<h3>Locally</h3>
First step, Install Elm. If you have your Node installed, you can use the following command to install Elm.
```
npm install -g elm
```
Then clone the code from the src/ folder (you may have to figure out importing the modules again)
Modules can be importing after exposing each code by:-
```
module <name of the file> exposing (..)
```
and then by importing on to the file you want to by:-
```
import <the module name> exposing (..)
```

After cloning the code type this ↓ in your terminal
```
elm reactor
```
Then copy the url generated on your browser to view the the code generated from the src/ folder

<div id = "About"><h2 align = "center">About the project 🤔</h2><div>
Our <b>web-app</b>, is a comprehensive <b>math practice tool</b> that offers a variety of features to help users improve their math skills. The main product is an <b>exam tool</b> that allows users to choose the number of questions and a custom timer for each question. The app tracks <b>progress</b> and displays best attempt and average marks after a minimum of two attempts. 
Additionally, it includes a tutorial page that provides basic methods for solving derivatives, integrals, and solid rotation questions. <b>The balloon popping mini-game</b> makes practicing math fun and engaging, with 10 levels that increase in difficulty as the user progresses. 
The <b>resource page</b> is a helpful tool that consolidates quality resources in four different languages, including books, YouTube channels, and math podcasts. 
Overall, our web app addresses the common problem of a lack of math practice and provides users with an effective solution to improve their math skills.

> ⚠️ <b>Please be advised that our web-app is currently in the prototype stage, and as such, may experience some technical issues or bugs.</b>

<div id = "Built"><h2 align = "center">Built with 🛠️</h2><div>
We built our web app purely using <b>Elm and the GraphicSVG library</b>. <b>Elm</b> is a functional programming language designed for building web applications. It is well-known for its speed, reliability and has a strong focus on user experience, making it a great choice for front-end development whereas <b>GraphicSVG</b> is an Elm library that enables developers to create dynamic and interactive graphics and animations using the functional programming paradigm. It is built on SVG and offers easy manipulation of graphical elements, making it ideal for creating responsive and customized designs.

We had created this project as part of our course CS1XD3 at McMaster University and thus used the McMaster Outreach code editor as our IDE. Therefore, the only way to view our app is through the IDE.

<div id = "Usage"><h2 align = "center">Usage 😀</h2><div>
Recalc is primarily designed to help users practice math through its various features, including the balloon popping mini-game and the customizable exam tool. The balloon popping mini-game is a fun and interactive way for users to practice math while progressing through increasingly difficult levels. As users pop balloons by solving math problems, they improve their skills and get a sense of achievement.

The customizable exam tool is another important feature of the app that allows users to practice math with timed quizzes of different difficulty levels. Users can select the number of questions and customize the time limit for each question. After completing the quiz, users can view their scores, best attempts, and average marks, which helps them to track their progress and improve their skills over time.

In addition to the mini-game and exam tool, Recalc also provides a tutorial page that offers basic methods for solving derivatives, integrals, and solid rotation questions. The resource page consolidates quality resources in four different languages, including books, YouTube channels, and math podcasts, which can be helpful for users seeking additional support. We know how hard it can be to find resources and how important learning math is in one's native language thus, we want to make learning math as simple and enjoyable as possible by making it easy for everyone to have access to the best resources in their native language.

The products main emphasis has always been to motivate users to practice as much as they can and we hope this solves a lot of problems!
